```lrc
[00:14.31] Nothing but everything
[00:21.54] I fall into you tonight
[00:28.56] Flowing forever, I'll go
[00:35.82] Warm like the southern light
[00:49.82] 
[00:43.12] I hear the quiet calling
[00:50.03] Coming from out the night
[00:57.21] I'm knowing here and now
[01:04.47] Always the loving's right
[01:16.97] 
[01:40.22] I feel it in the morning time
[01:47.53] Like this man I know
[01:54.43] Who walks like he's lost the light
[02:01.58] But knows that he's had it before
[02:18.08] 
[02:12.45] I know you're like me, like no other
[02:30.45] 
[02:26.79] I know you're like me, like no other
[02:44.79] 
[02:41.04] I know you're like me, like no other
